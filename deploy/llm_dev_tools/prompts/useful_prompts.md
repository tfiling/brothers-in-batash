## Test Implementation:

Implement tests for <> . Make sure the tests fully covers the code.
Make sure that each test tests a single use case.
Make sure you add "Arrange" "Act" "Assert" comments.
Make sure the test uses the mock type <> as a dependency injection for <>
The tests naming convention should be: Test<tested type>_<tested method>__<tested use case in snake case>
The project's source code:

## Implement CRUD API controller

# code 1:

I would like to implement a new controller type that would expose CRUD API for <>
Generate a code block of const strings that would be used as URIs for the crude API.
The project's source code:

# code 2:

Implement a new controller type named <> that would expose CRUD API for <>
The new controller should be using fiber package
The new controller should implement the controllers.Controller interface
The new controller should accept the following types ( marked with * ) to it's constructor function and store them as
properties:
* <>
  When registering it's API routes it should use the above string consts
  A relevant example would be controllers.ShiftController
  Avoid any explanations

# tests 1:

Implement a mock type for interface <>
Avoid any explanations

# tests 2:

Implement tests for <>
Make sure the tests fully covers the code.
Make sure the tests make use of the following mocks ( marked with * ) as dependencies for <> :

* <>
  Make sure that each test tests a single use case
  Make sure you add "Arrange" "Act" "Assert" comments
  Make sure you assert expectations for the mocks being used
  The tests naming convention should be: Test<tested type>_<tested method>__<tested use case in snake case>

## Implement data store access object for model

# code 1:

I would like to implement a new data store access type for <>
Implement a new type named <> that will implement the interface <>
A good example would be store.InMemShiftStore
