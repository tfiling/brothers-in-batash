When  implementing tests for a backend component located in backend dir apply the following guidelines:
- Implement tests in a file named <tested component name>_test.go
- Locate tests in <pkg name>_test package ( black-box approach )
- Use testify/assert for test assertions github.com/stretchr/testify
- USe testify/require for test requirements assertions https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify/require
- Use table-driven tests when testing multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies using interfaces
- Each test function should be named declared as follows Test<tested component name in camel case>_<method name>__<use case name>(t *testing.T)
- Each test function should have the following structure:
//Arrange
<set up and declare expected mocked store objects behaviour>
//Act
<Execute the tested flow>
//Assert
<Assertion statements using testify>
